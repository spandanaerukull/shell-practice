#variables.sh
#variables are used to store values
#there are two types of variables
#1. system variables    
#2. user-defined variables
#system variables are defined by the system and user-defined variables are defined by the user  
#to define a variable we use the syntax VARIABLE_NAME=value
#to access the value of a variable we use the syntax $VARIABLE_NAME 
#there should be no space between VARIABLE_NAME, = and value
#by convention, variable names are in uppercase letters 
#example of user-defined variables
#NAME=spandana
